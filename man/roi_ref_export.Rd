\arguments{
\item{name_list}{list of metabolite names if cas numbers are not provided}

\item{cas_list}{list of CAS registry numbers written as characters if metabolite names are not provided}

\item{return_metabs}{string, must be one of "exact_match" or "all". Defaults to "all". If "exact_match", returns metabolites that exactly match specified experimental conditions (solvent type, pH, and instrument strength). If "all", returns all entries corresponding to supplied CAS numbers, experimental conditions ignored.}

\item{solvent_type}{the experimental solvent, choose from available solvents 'D2O', 'H2O', ...}

\item{ph}{the experimental pH}

\item{half_bandwidth}{This will be set to 1.4 unless otherwise specified}

\item{roi_tol}{The chemical shift tolerance, tolerance for the location of the peak center. Default is 0.005.}

\item{instrument_strength}{the spectrometer frequency of the instrument used to collect the data}

\item{temperature}{numeric value specifying the temperature}

\item{concentration}{numeric value specifying the concentration}
